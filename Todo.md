### Todo
- New outline item
	- Do not place dash when cursor is at beginning of line
	- No new line and reduce indent by one when where no text on line
	- Do not place dash when line is completely empty (this seems to happen a few lines below an outline item)
		- This looks like a TextMate error: the scope says its an outline item, even though it isn't
- Move item up/down
	- Keep cursor in same place when moving items up and down
	- Introduce ability to move multiple lines
